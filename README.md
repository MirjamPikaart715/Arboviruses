# Arboviruses
Designing primers for detection of multiple arboviruses intended for an amplicon based MinION sequence platform.

# NCBI Virus
The arbovirus sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Virus database. Nucleotide completeness was set to ‘complete’, and the sequence were ordered by length, starting with the longest sequences. Both GenBank and RefSeq sequences were downloaded.
For the Bunyaviridae sequences, only sequences from segment L were downloaded.

# Uclust
For designing primers for the detection of arboviruses, the virus sequences were clustered with a 95% identity cut-off using Uclust with the following script: https://github.com/MirjamPikaart715/Arboviruses/blob/master/Scripts/flaviviridae_cluster.sh

# Multiple sequence alignment
The clustered sequences were aligned with two multiple alignment tools, Clustal Omega and Muscle. Both the tools provided the output in fasta format with the following scripts:

Muscle

# Primer3
To design the primers, the alignments were screened for conserved regions using BioEdit. A consenus seqeunce of the conserved region was made and used as sequence_template for Primer3 Most of the conserved regions were not long enough to make primer pairs. A left or right primer was made for conserved regions that were not that far apart from each other.

Some conserved regions were more than 200 sequences long. For these regions primer pairs were made by the following Boulder-IO record:

With the designed primers, the FASTA file with the conserved regions were screened if the primer could or could not bind to the conserved region of all the sequences within an alignment. The conserved regions that match with the primer were written into another FASTA file using the standard Sequence Input/Output (SeqIO) of Biopython.
